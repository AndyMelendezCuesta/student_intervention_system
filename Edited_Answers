Change #2
Justification is provided for which model seems to be the best by comparing the computational cost and accuracy of each model.
There is possibly been a misunderstanding regarding the purpose of this question: The final choice should be justified by clearly and explicitly comparing and contrasting the computational costs and F1 scores between the three models chosen and at different train sizes, please provide more details when comparing each algorithms' time and performance (by reporting them explicitly in your discussion) with the other algorithms to make your case and support your choice.
##############In simple terms: Compare-contrast the times and F1 scores from the table to justify that using SVM is the best choice.

Change #3
Student is able to clearly and concisely describe how the optimal model works in laymen terms to someone what is not familiar with machine learning nor has a technical background.
The explanation is a bit too vague, by reading your description of the algorithm I'm not fully able to understand specifically how it actually works, how it is trained and how it produces the final results. The goal here should be to explain how the algorithm works in a clear and simple way so that someone that is not accustomed to machine learning would be able to understand and describe the mechanism behind the specific algorithm. To meet requirements your description should cover the following topics:

-A description of the algorithm.
-A description of how the algorithm is trained.
-A description of how the algorithm makes predictions.
You could try explaining the logic of the algorithm through everyday examples and/or by including some plots that might help the audience understand the algorithm. Please discuss the kernel trick, margin maximization and the role of support vectors as those are the fundamental elements in vector machines. Sketches or drawings would be helpful explaining that as well, Iâ€™m including some for your reference.
#############They mean that: 
#### A description of the algorithm: 
#### A decription of how the algorith is trained:
#### A description of how the algorithm makes predictions:
#############Most common examples that I can find
####Describe the kernel trick
####Describe the margin maximization
####Describe the role of support vectors (as those are fundamental elements in vector machines)
#############I gotta include the plots that they gave me.
***************DO SPECIALIZED RESEARCH ABOUT SVM AND TYPE MY SUMMARY AND INCLUDE THE LINKS***************

Change #4

The final model chosen is correctly tuned using gridsearch with at least one parameter using at least three settings. If the model does not need any parameter tuning it is explicitly stated with reasonable justification.
Please refrain from restricting the data when running grid search, please use the same training testator used previously in order to provide a fair comparison among the results. This data set is quite small therefore results might be influenced by randomization, using the same train and test set used for the algorithms avoids that issue.
#############In other words: Use the X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test obtained from the not-refined SVM version.
