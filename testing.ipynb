    "In the terminology of machine learning, classification [Statistical classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) is considered an instance of supervised learning, i.e. learning where a training set of correctly identified observations is available. The corresponding unsupervised procedure is known as clustering, and involves grouping data into categories based on some measure of inherent similarity or distance. Based on the definition of classification we can clearly see that this supervised learning problem belongs to classification as our main task is to arrange the students in basically two categories: the students who need early intervention from the ones who are on the right track to graduate. The final goal is to identify the students who need early help so that they can successfuly graduate."

    " Based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance I chose \"Support Vector Classification\" or \"SVM\" as the best model. I followed the logic of the Machine Learning scikit-learn diagram [ML scikit-learn diagram](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/). Given that I count with less than 100k samples, that I am working with non text data, and that SVM classification is known to be more accurate than Decision Tree classification. [SVM classification](http://web.stanford.edu/dept/itss/docs/oracle/10g/text.101/b10729/classify.htm#i1007173). I also discared the Bagging classifier because it is mostly used for artificial neural networks, classification, regression trees, and subset selection in linear regression [Bootstrap aggregating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating). Of course I also discared the linear SVC because compared to the nonlinear SVC, the linear SVC tends to return an underfit model [linear SVC](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#classification). In the end following the logic of the diagram I was lead to work with the non linear SVM model.\n",
